GOLEMS

You can make the 2nd phase the default phase the golems are in, If they use "ATTACK A" they will downgrade to Phase 1. 

Once in Phase 1
- The golem will not be able to move anymore but will be able to use 2 attacks. 
- When using "ATTACK B" the golem will dash towards the target. 
- The golem can go back to Phase 2 by using the "RESET" animation

For the golem to reach Phase 3, it has to use the "ABILITY" animation when in Phase 2.

Once in Phase 3
- The golem will be able to move
- The golem use 3 attacks and also go into shield mode. 
- When using the reinforced "ATTACK 3" the golem will create a projectile and will be pushed back. 
- To use the shield you have to use the reinforced "ABILITY" animation. You can make it into 3 animations:
		1) Starts the shield animation
		2) Consists of 1 frame in which the golem is fully covered in the shield
		3) Ends the shield animation

Phase 3 is optional. 
- You can combine Golem A and B and dont use the "ABILITY" animation from the Golem B. This can be the first enemy.
- The Phase 3 can be used by itself as the second enemy. If you choose to do this you will have to play the Phase 3 "DEATH" animation followed by the Phase 2 "DEATH" animation
